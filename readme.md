# IBM Watson Workspace Q&A Bot

This bot supports an information discovery use case.

## Usage
When users ask questions, the bot
identifies the question phrase and provides cognitive metadata
(e.g. Entities, Concepts, Keywords, etc) that can be used for information retrieval.

Answers are provided as cards to the user. A user can then select the appropriate answer for more detail.

## Installation

Details on installation can be found in the [watsonworkspace-starter](https://github.com/van-ibm/watsonworkspace-starter) project.

## Customization

You should add your own custom ways of finding answers to users questions. Possible services include [Watson Discovery](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/discovery/) or keyword based searches to popular websites.
